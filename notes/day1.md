Step 1 in RL is always: Create the EnvironmentThe environment defines:

States - What can the agent observe?
Actions - What can the agent do?
Rewards - What's good/bad?
Transitions - How does the world change?


For Games (Easy!)

States: Board position
Actions: Legal moves
Rewards: Win (+1), Lose (-1), Draw (0)
Transitions: Deterministic rules

This is why games are popular for learning RL - environment is simple to code!
